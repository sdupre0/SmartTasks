#Smart Tasks#

A task list app made as part of the home assignment for an interview with TCP Software.

##Questions I wasn't able to receive feedback on##
- Needed more thorough UX guidelines
    - Incorrect color hex for the green
    - What device DPI is being targeted with the pixel measurements in the existing guidelines?
    - Max length or lines for text?
    - Where does the status icon go on a task in the list?
    - Where do comments show in a task's details? Replace the button? Above or below the status icon?

##Out of scope or time-restricted improvements I would make##
- Unit and UI tests with JUnit and Espresso
    - I focused on completing the functional code first and ran out of time for a full suite of tests
    - I know this goes against TDD principles so I apologize for that
- Ability for more comments for an exchange between the user and manager
- Hide the bottom navigation bar
- A method of making the List Fragment return to the same date the user left
